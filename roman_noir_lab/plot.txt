Suzy Gao Xing, a 26 years-old journalist living in Hong-Kong, suddenly disappeared. Her sister, Beatrice Gao Xing, engages a private detective in order to look for her.

Q1: Why not work with the local police ?
A1: Beatrice Gao Xing doesn't want to work with HK police, because she thinks Suzy might have disappeared for political reasons.

Q2: How much time should be allocated to the private detective ?
A2: Budget allows for about 2 months of work.

Q3: Why did Beatrice chose to work with a French private detective ?
A3: Beatrice picked a French private detective, because her family is French. Also, working with a French speaking professional is easier for her. A local private detective might have been at least as competent, but again, she fears political interferences.

Q4: What is the personal opinion of Beatrice ?
A4: Beatrice is not sure what happened to her sister Suzy, but considering she was a journalist working in Hong-Kong writing somewhat political articles, it's not hard to see how that could have gone wrong.
